With his slow movements and perpetually calm demeanor, he’s the laid-back friend everyone needs. Hanging lazily from a branch in the lush treetops of the rainforest, Sudipto takes his time with everything—whether it’s eating, sleeping, or moving from one tree to the next. He’s not in any rush and has perfected the art of enjoying the moment. Sudipto might not be the most energetic, but when he does decide to make a move, you can count on it being deliberate and thoughtful. He’s also a big fan of naps, so you’ll often find him curled up in his favorite spot, content in his slow-paced world.</P>
