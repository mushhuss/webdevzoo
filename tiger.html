    <p style="border: 2px solid white; padding: 10px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);">Travis is a proud and fierce tiger, with a heart as wild as his spirit. Strong and confident, he’s the king of his jungle, always alert and ready to protect his territory. His majestic orange coat, marked with striking black stripes, is a symbol of his power and beauty. While he has an intense, independent nature, Travis isn’t all roar and growl—he has a soft side for those who earn his trust. Deep down, he’s protective of his family and close friends. He’s a natural hunter, always on the prowl, and when he’s not exploring the wild, he enjoys lounging by the river or basking in the sun, looking fierce and calm at the same time.</p>
